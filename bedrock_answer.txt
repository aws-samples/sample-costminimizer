This is a placeholder answer for the question: Based on the information provided in the CSV data, both instances shown need to be rightsized:

1. Instance with ID i-01a0dcf1f863bc563 (named "launch2-test-ec2-instances-instance-1")
2. Instance with ID i-0ba53df54d7a21315 (named "launch2-test-ec2-instances-instance-2")

Both instances are listed as "Over-provisioned" in the "finding" column, indicating they are candidates for rightsizing. They are both currently t3.large instances, and the data suggests they could be downsized to improve cost efficiency while still meeting performance needs.
